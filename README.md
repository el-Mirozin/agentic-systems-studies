Repo to save and share whatever I'm studying about LLMs and its applications

As of now, this repo contains only a simple agent that reads an investment portfolio listed on a B3 pdf and analyzes how diversified your investments are. My idea is to create other, similar, mini-agents and expand this repo, until I can create a multi-agent system  concatenating the use of all these little ones.

<bold>Instructions:</bold> if you wish to use it without any adaptations to code, you need to have an investment portfolio from B3 and a Gemini API key, and you should export them (or their path, in the case of the pdf) as environment variables called PDF_PATH and GEMINI_API_KEY, respectively.
